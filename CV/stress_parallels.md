The dissertation investigates formal abstract stress-prosodic systems defined within Optimality Theory (OT). The primary goal is to understand the structure of stress-prosodic typologies. The analysis shows parallels between deletion, culminativity, and quantity-insensitivity.

### Analysis

The dissertation presents an analysis of nGo, a stress-prosodic system that is identical to the [nGX system  (Alber and Prince 2015, ms.)](https://roa.rutgers.edu/article/view/1663.html) but has one main difference: nGo permits syllable deletion and has faithfulness constraints. 

I examine the formal languages of the extensional typology and identified real languages as empirical support. 

I also analyse grammars in terms of [Property Theory (Alber & Prince 2015, ms.)](https://roa.rutgers.edu/article/view/1838.html) and propose property families.
