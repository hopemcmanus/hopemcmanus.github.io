# About Me

My name is Hope McManus ([ˈhoʊp məkˈmænəs]; she/her). 

I work in learning, language and data.  

My experience includes teaching, learning design and development, data analysis and classification and formal research. 

During my career, I've:
- taught English and UCAT Preparation to high school students and Linguistics and academic writing  to undergraduate students
- analysed and classified information to create information catalogues and train AI systems, and
- developed formal, abstract systems to explore what's (im)possible in language.
