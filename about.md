# About Me

My name is Hope McManus ([ˈhoʊp məkˈmænəs]; she/her). 

I work at the intersection of learning, language and data.  

My experience spans teaching and learning, data analysis and classification and formal research. 

During my career, I've:
- taught English and UCAT Preparation to high school students and Linguistics and academic writing  to undergraduate students
- analysed and classified information to create information catalogues and train AI systems, and
- developed formal, abstract language models to predict what's (im)possible in language.
